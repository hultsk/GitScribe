## Project Idea: 
Git Helper Bot with AI-Powered Commit Message Suggestions

## Overview:
Create a Git helper bot that analyzes the changes made in a Git repository and provides intelligent suggestions for commit messages. The bot can use OpenAI's language model to generate relevant and descriptive commit messages based on the modifications made to the codebase.

## Key Features:

* __Git Integration:__ 
   Implement functionality to interact with the Git repository, including retrieving information about modified files, additions, deletions, and file contents.

* __Change Analysis:__
   Analyze the changes made in each commit to identify the scope and nature of the modifications. This could involve parsing diffs, examining code deltas, and detecting patterns in the changes.

* __AI-Powered Suggestions:__
   Leverage OpenAI's language models (such as GPT) to generate commit message suggestions based on the detected changes. Utilize these models to learn patterns and conventions commonly used in commit messages.

* __Suggestion Generation:__
   Generate commit message suggestions that accurately summarize the changes made in each commit. The suggestions should be concise, informative, and follow best practices for writing commit messages (e.g., using imperative mood, providing context).

* __User Interaction:__
   Provide a user interface (e.g., command-line interface or graphical interface) where users can view the suggested commit messages, customize them if necessary, and commit the changes with the chosen message.

## Example Workflow:

1. User makes changes to files in the Git repository.
2. User invokes the Git helper bot to analyze the changes and provide commit message suggestions.
3. The bot analyzes the modifications and generates one or more suggested commit messages based on the detected changes.
4. The user reviews the suggested commit messages, makes any necessary adjustments, and selects one for the commit.
5. The changes are committed to the repository with the chosen commit message.

## Development Steps:

* Set up a C# project and integrate Git functionality using libraries like LibGit2Sharp for interacting with Git repositories.
* Implement logic to analyze changes in the repository and extract relevant information for commit message generation.
* Integrate OpenAIâ€™s language model to generate commit message suggestions based on the detected changes.
* Develop a user interface for interacting with the Git helper bot and displaying suggested commit messages.
